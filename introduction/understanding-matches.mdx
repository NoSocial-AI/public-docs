## Introduction 

Most hiring tools are optimized for one side: either the employer’s search or the candidate’s job feed. NoSocial explicitly evaluates every potential match from both perspectives.

- Each job is ranked based on how well it fits _your_ stated requirements and hidden constraints (e.g. salary floor, remote-only, industry preferences).
- You see opportunities that respect your non-negotiables instead of being spammed with everything vaguely related to your title.

You see fewer, higher-quality matches instead of endless lists of mediocre ones.

## Match Quality

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="High Match" icon="star" color="#16a34a">
    85-100% compatibility. Strong match on most almost all requirements. High probability of securing an interview.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Good Match" icon="check" color="#2563eb">
    75-85% compatibility. A good match that strongly matches on the most imporant requirements.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Potential Match" icon="circle-question" color="#ca8a04">
    70-75% compatibility. May need further information to improve or is not a good fit.
  </Card>

## Explaninability

NoSocial's AI is able to explain and provide context on why a certain match quality is ranked higher. You can see this in the match description.  Explainability is based on the evaluation that the system has performed and is not a generic explanation.
