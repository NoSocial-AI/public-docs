## Overview

NoSocial revolutionizes job matching by using AI agents that work on behalf of both candidates and employers, ensuring privacy while delivering high-quality matches. Unlike traditional platforms, your private information and deal-breakers remain confidential throughout the entire process.

## The NoSocial Method

## How It Works: Step by Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Candidates Share Their Profile">
    Candidates provide their work history by uploading their CV or connecting their LinkedIn profile. This forms the foundation of their professional profile on NoSocial.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Candidates Set Private Instructions">
    Candidates provide detailed instructions about what they're looking for, including:
    - Role preferences and requirements
    - Deal-breakers (e.g., "no agencies", "must be remote")
    - Salary expectations
    - Work culture preferences
    - Other private information
    
    **Important:** This information is only available to your personal AI agent and is never shared with employers.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Employers Create Job Postings">
    Employers provide a job description along with their own private instructions, which may include:
    - Hidden requirements
    - Budget constraints
    - Team dynamicsNoSocial's mission is to deliver continuous opportunityâ€”matching every professional and employer as intent and markets evolve
    - Strategic hiring goals
    
    **Important:** This private information remains confidential and is only used by the employer's AI agent.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Generates Two-Sided Matches">
    NoSocial's AI analyzes both sides independently and generates matches that are evaluated from two perspectives:
    - **Candidate POV:** How well does this job fit the candidate's requirements?
    - **Employer POV:** How well does this candidate fit the role?
    
    Each match receives two separate scores, ensuring both parties' interests are represented.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Feedback Refines Understanding">
    Both candidates and employers review their matches and provide feedback. The AI learns from this feedback to:
    - Improve future match quality
    - Better understand preferences
    - Provide actionable insights to users
    - Refine its matching algorithm
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Continuous Improvement">
    As both candidates and employers interact with the platform, their understanding of what they want evolves. The AI adapts to these changes, resulting in progressively better matches over time.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Privacy Always Protected">
    Throughout the entire process, no private or personally identifiable information (PII) is shared between candidates and employers until both parties mutually agree to connect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Matching Timeline

```mermaid
timeline
    title Match Quality Evolution
    Initial Setup : Basic profile & instructions
                  : First matches generated
    Week 1-2 : Provide feedback on matches
             : AI learns preferences
    Week 3-4 : Match quality improves
             : More relevant opportunities
    Ongoing : Continuous refinement
            : Evolving understanding
            : Higher quality matches
```

## How Feedback Improves Matches

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when you rate a match?">
    When you rate a match (positive or negative), the AI analyzes:
    - What aspects you liked or disliked
    - Patterns across your feedback
    - How to adjust future recommendations
    - What insights to share with you about your preferences
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does the AI learn from feedback?">
    The AI uses your feedback to:
    - Refine understanding of your stated preferences
    - Discover unstated preferences through patterns
    - Weight different criteria based on importance
    - Identify deal-breakers you may not have explicitly mentioned
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What feedback does the AI provide to users?">
    Based on your interactions, the AI may provide insights like:
    - "You tend to prefer smaller companies over large corporations"
    - "Remote work appears to be more important than you indicated"
    - "You might want to expand your search to include [X] industry"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy Protection

<Warning>
  NoSocial takes privacy seriously. Here's what's NEVER shared without your explicit consent:
</Warning>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Candidate Privacy">
    **Protected Information:**
    - Current employer (if specified as private)
    - Salary expectations and requirements
    - Deal-breakers and red flags
    - Personal preferences and constraints
    - Contact information
    - Location (if set to private)
    
    **Shared Only After Mutual Interest:**
    - Full name
    - Direct contact details
    - Complete work history
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Employer Privacy">
    **Protected Information:**
    - Budget and salary range details
    - Internal hiring requirements
    - Team composition concerns
    - Strategic hiring plans
    - Company challenges
    - Competitive information
    
    **Shared Only After Mutual Interest:**
    - Company name (if obfuscated)
    - Hiring manager details
    - Team structure

## The Two-Sided Match Explained

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Job Posting] --> C[AI Analysis]
    B[Candidate Profile] --> C
    C --> D[Candidate Match Score]
    C --> E[Employer Match Score]
    
    D --> F{85% Match}
    E --> G{92% Match}
    
    F --> H[Candidate Sees: <br/>85% fit for you]
    G --> I[Employer Sees: <br/>92% fit for role]
    
    style F fill:#10B981
    style G fill:#10B981
    style C fill:#1E3A8A
```

**Why Two Scores?**
- A candidate might be great for a job (employer's 92% match)
- But the job might not be perfect for the candidate (candidate's 85% match)
- Both perspectives matter for a successful hire
