title: "Continuous Matching"
description: "Description of your new file."
---

Traditional platforms run a search only when you hit “apply” or “search”. NoSocial runs matching continuously in the background.

- Once your instructions are set, the system keeps looking for better fits as new roles and companies come in.
- When you update your preferences (e.g. salary, location, role seniority), your existing matches are re-evaluated against the new criteria.

The result: match quality improves the longer you use the system, without extra manual work.  Every generation of matching improves upon the previous. \
