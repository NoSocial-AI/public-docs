title: "Context & Intent"
description: "How context and intent provide higher quality outcomes vs CVs and JDs. "
---

CVs and JDs capture history and wishlists. They rarely capture what either side is actually trying to achieve _right now_. NoSocial puts context and intent at the center of matching.

For candidates, context and intent can include things like:

- What you want next (e.g. “first PM role”, “move from agency to product company”, “lead a small team”)
- Constraints (visa, relocation, caregiving responsibilities, commute limits)
- Workstyle and culture preferences (product maturity, speed, autonomy, management style)

For employers, context and intent can include:

- Why this role exists (new product, replacement, scaling a team, turnaround situation)
- Team maturity and expectations (greenfield vs maintenance, experimentation vs stability)
- Strategic goals (e.g. “ship X in 6 months”, “build v1”, “reduce operational load by Y%”)

Most of this information stays private to your AI agent. It is used to shape which matches you see and how they are prioritized, not to create a public profile.

The benefit is simple: the system doesn’t just ask “Can this person _do_ the job?” but “Is this the _right_ job for this person, in this context, at this moment?”—for both sides.
