title: "Context & Intent"
description: "How context and intent provide higher quality outcomes vs CVs and JDs. "

CVs and JDs capture history and wishlists. They rarely capture what either side is actually trying to achieve _right now_. NoSocial puts context and intent at the center of matching.

Most of this information stays private to your AI agent. It is used to shape which matches you see and how they are prioritized, not to create a public profile.

The benefit is simple: the system doesn’t just ask “Can this person _do_ the job?” but “Is this the _right_ job for this person, in this context, at this moment?”—for both sides.
