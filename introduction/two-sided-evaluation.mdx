## Two-Sided Matching

Most hiring tools are optimized for one side: either the employer’s search or the candidate’s job feed. NoSocial explicitly evaluates every potential match from both perspectives.

For candidates:

- Each job is ranked based on how well it fits _your_ stated requirements and hidden constraints (e.g. salary floor, remote-only, industry preferences).
- You see opportunities that respect your non-negotiables instead of being spammed with everything vaguely related to your title.

For employers:

- Each candidate is evaluated against what the role actually needs, including private instructions like budget constraints or team composition.
- You get a prioritized list of candidates who fit the _real_ requirements, not just keyword matches from a CV.

For the marketplace:

- Matches that score well for both sides are pushed up; matches that are one-sided are de-emphasized.
- This reduces time wasted on interviews that were never going to work out and increases the share of “mutual fit” conversations.

You see fewer, higher-quality matches instead of endless lists of mediocre ones.
