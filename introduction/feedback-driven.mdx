## How Feedback Improves Matches

NoSocial learns from the feedback you provide to matches. For every match you reject, the reason for your rejection is used to improve the next generation of matches.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when you rate a match?">
    When you feedback on a match (positive or negative), the AI analyzes:

    - What aspects you liked or disliked
    - Patterns across your feedback
    - How to adjust future recommendations
    - What insights to share with you about your preferences
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does the AI learn from feedback?">
    The AI uses your feedback to:

    - Refine understanding of your stated preferences
    - Discover unstated preferences through patterns
    - Identify deal-breakers you may not have explicitly mentioned
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What feedback does the AI provide to users?">
    Based on your interactions, the AI may provide insights like:

    - "You tend to prefer smaller companies over large corporations"
    - "Remote work appears to be more important than you indicated"
    - "You might want to expand your search to include [X] industry"
