## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Setup your instructions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review and Edit default instructions" defaultOpen icon="terminal">
    During the onboarding process, NoSocial sets up a default set of AI instructions that are based on the profile you provided (CV or LinkedIn). \
    \
    Review these instructions, especially the ideal role and deal breakers sections. Edit and save the instructions to upate the system.Â 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start the preview server" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

    <Tip>
      Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our GitHub app" icon="github">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update your site name and colors" icon="palette">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>
      Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion title="Publish your docs" icon="rocket">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>
