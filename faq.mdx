## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is this different from LinkedIn?">
    NoSocial is private and intent-driven. You don't browse a feed; the AI brings you curated matches based on deep context, not just keywords.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is my profile public?">
    No. Your profile is only visible to employers who are a high match, and you can choose to remain anonymous until you connect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    NoSocial is free for candidates. Employers pay for successful matches or subscription tiers.

## Troubleshooting

### No Matches?

If you aren't getting matches:

1. **Check your Instructions:** Are they too restrictive?
2. **Update Profile:** Add more skills or details.
3. **Wait:** The system matches continuously; new opportunities may appear tomorrow.
