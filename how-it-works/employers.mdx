## Creating a Job Posting

To get the best candidates, you need more than a standard Job Description.

1.  **Job Details:** Title, description, responsibilities.
2.  **Private Instructions:** Tell the AI what you *really* need.
    - "Must have startup experience."
    - "Budget is strict $120k."
    - "Need someone who can wear multiple hats."
3.  **Publish:** The system immediately starts evaluating existing candidates against your criteria.

## AI Evaluations

NoSocial uses AI to evaluate every candidate against your specific role requirements.

- **Skill Matching:** Beyond keywords, understanding depth and context.
- **Cultural Fit:** Aligning work styles and preferences.
- **Two-Sided Score:** Ensuring the candidate is also interested in your type of role.

**Score Tiers:**
- **Excellent (90-100%):** Strong mutual fit.
- **Good (70-89%):** Solid option, meets core needs.
- **Potential (50-69%):** May have gaps but worth considering.

## Managing Matches

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review" icon="eye">
    See detailed AI analysis of why a candidate is a match.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accept/Decline" icon="check-double">
    **Accept:** Express interest. If they accept too, you connect.
    **Decline:** Remove from list. This teaches the AI what you don't want.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Best Practices:**
- **Rate Matches:** Always accept or decline. Leaving matches "pending" prevents the AI from learning.
- **Provide Feedback:** If you decline, tell the AI why (e.g., "Too junior", "Wrong industry").
