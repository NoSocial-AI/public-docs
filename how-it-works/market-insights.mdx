Market insights help you understand how your search (as a candidate or employer) aligns with what is actually available in the market.

They do **not** change your matches directly. They give you context so you can adjust your intent, constraints, or expectations.

Market insights are delivered periodically when there is a significant change in conditions that impacts you based on your updated instructions or market conditions.

## What are market insights?

Market insights are aggregated signals derived from:

- The roles and candidates currently active on NoSocial.
- How similar searches have performed over time.
- The feedback loop between candidates and employers.

They answer questions like:

- “Is my search too narrow or too broad?”
- “How realistic are my constraints vs what’s available?”
- “Where is the market dense vs thin for my intent?”

No individual user’s data is exposed; insights are always shown in aggregate.

## When do insights matter?

You should pay attention to market insights when:

- You get **very few or no matches** for a search.
- You see **many matches but low mutual interest** (low approval / reply rates).
- You are considering **tight constraints** (e.g. salary, location, seniority, niche skills).
- You want to **test alternative scenarios** without rewriting everything.

## How to use market insights as a candidate

Use insights to tune your search so you are discoverable where the market is actually active.

Typical adjustments:

1. **Location and flexibility**
   - Check if there is enough demand in your target geography.
   - If insights indicate limited roles locally, consider:
     - Expanding to nearby regions.
     - Allowing remote / hybrid where acceptable.
2. **Seniority and scope**
   - If most roles are one level above/below your target, decide:
     - Whether you’re willing to stretch up (more responsibility).
     - Or step sideways/down to enter a new domain.
3. **Compensation expectations**
   - If your stated range is significantly above what’s common in similar searches, you can:
     - Narrow to employers who explicitly support that range.
     - Or adjust expectations to increase match volume.
4. **Intent clarity**
   - If insights show that many similar candidates exist but conversions are low, your instructions may be too vague.
   - Make your **“non-negotiables”** and **“nice-to-haves”** explicit so the system can separate signal from noise.

## How to use market insights as an employer

Use insights to make sure your role is structured and described in a way that can actually be filled.

Typical adjustments:

1. **Search radius and work setup**
   - If insights indicate very few candidates within your current location constraints:
     - Consider expanding to a wider area.
     - Re-evaluate whether fully on-site is truly required.
2. **Role profile vs market reality**
   - If the market is dense for adjacent roles but thin for your exact combination:
     - Decide what can be relaxed (tech stack, domain, years of experience).
     - Clarify what is truly critical vs “wishlist”.
3. **Compensation and level**
   - Use insights to see if your compensation band sits well below where similar candidates cluster.
   - Either:
     - Adjust the band, or
     - Narrow the role to a different level (e.g. mid vs senior) that matches your budget.
4. **Instructions for your AI agent**
   - If approvals are low despite available candidates:
     - Your instructions may be over-constraining or ambiguous.
     - Highlight:
       - Deal-breakers.
       - Context about team, product, and growth trajectory.
       - What historically worked / did not work in similar hires.

## Limitations

- Insights are based on **NoSocial’s current data**, not the entire global job market.
- For very narrow or new searches, insights may be limited until enough activity exists.
- They are directional guidance, not guarantees of outcome.
