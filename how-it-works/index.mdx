## Overview

Unlike a point-in-time evaluation of a CV and Job Description, our AI-enabled system is continuously matching based on feedback from interactions between candidates and employers, making static CVs and Job Descriptions largely obsolete.

Matches are brokered by the AI system that mediates the connection while respecting data privacy and data sharing. The result of this approach is that both sides of the market (supply and demand) have the best possible match outcomes available to them.

    Every candidate and job is evaluated continuously. Market level insights are generated to guide the search.

    Every match is scored from both the candidate's and employer's perspective for fair representation and noise reduction.

## How It Works: Step by Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Candidates Share Their Profile">
    Candidates provide their work history by uploading their CV or connecting their LinkedIn profile. This forms the foundation of their professional profile on NoSocial.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Candidates Set Private Instructions">
    Candidates provide detailed instructions about what they're looking for, including:

    - Role preferences and requirements
    - Deal-breakers (e.g., "no agencies", "must be remote")
    - Salary expectations
    - Work culture preferences
    - Other private information

    **Important:** This information is only available to your personal AI agent and is never shared with employers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Employers Create Job Postings">
    Employers provide a job description along with their own private instructions, which may include:

    - Hidden requirements
    - Budget constraints
    - Team dynamics
    - Strategic hiring goals

    **Important:** This private information remains confidential and is only used by the employer's AI agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Generates Two-Sided Matches">
    NoSocial's AI analyzes both sides independently and generates matches that are evaluated from two perspectives:

    - **Candidate POV:** How well does this job fit the candidate's requirements?
    - **Employer POV:** How well does this candidate fit the role?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Interview or Dismiss">
    Both candidates and employers review their matches and provide feedback. The AI learns from this feedback. If an interview is requested, the counter party is notified for approval.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous Improvement">
    As both candidates and employers interact with the platform, their understanding of what they want evolves. The AI adapts to these changes, resulting in progressively better matches over time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Privacy Always Protected">
    Throughout the entire process, no private or personally identifiable information (PII) is shared between candidates and employers until both parties mutually agree to connect.
  </Step>
</Steps>
